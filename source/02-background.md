# Background

## Assumptions

* Users of this project don't wish to learn much (or any) LaTeX, and have some familiarity with Markdown.
* Users of this project have access to a computer that can run Docker.

### Scope

This project provides a framework for writing Markdown, to convert it to PDF in the style of a LaTeX document.

Certain common tasks have been included in the scope:

* Support for LaTeX (tex math) formulae.
* Numbering of sections.
* Prepending a cover page.
* Prepending a table of contents.
* Appending a bibliography for citations.

Determining the best structure for your project, or the content you should include in your write-up is left as an exercise for the reader.
