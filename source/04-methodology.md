# Methodology

## Footnotes

It's easy to write a footnote[^1].

[^1]: Indicate your footnote with `[^1]` and provide the text of it close by using `[^1]: this is the text`

## Citations

Cite your bibliography using @-notation. For example, you could refer to this paper about Paralysis Proofs @ParalysisProofs.

## Formulae

As described in `README.md` you can write LaTeX formulae by surrounding them with `$` signs, eg.

$C_K = K + a^{2^t} \mod{n}$

NB. There should be no space after the opening `$` and no space before the closing `$`.

## Figures

To include a figure in your document, provide it as a Markdown image. The alternative text will be used as the figure's description, eg.

![Here is an aperture icon](resources/aperture.png){ width=100px }

If you do not provide alternative text, the image will be included but not as a figure.

To adjust the size of your image, you can provide some information in a suffix to the image markdown, eg. `{ width=100px }`
